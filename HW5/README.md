# Homework 5
(Only NumPy and data visualization packages are allowed.) 

1. Read through Slide11 and 12, watch video lectures of neural networks.
2. Run the code “[8_NN_2layer.py](8_NN_2layer.py)” (blackboard) 
3. Trains the NN more than 1,000 times and observe the change of the loss value.
4. Implement a **“3-6-2” network** (using code [8_NN_2layer.py](8_NN_2layer.py)) to fit the following data:  
```
X=np.array(([0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]), dtype=float)
y=np.array(([0,1],[1,0],[1,0],[0,1]), dtype=float)
```
5. What are the dimension of weight matrix 1 and weight matrix 2? (5pts)
6. Test the two following samples and write down the predicted y values for them. (5 pts)
Testing sample one: X1 = [0, 0, 0]    y1=[? ?] 
Testing sample two: X2 = [1,1,1]      y2=[? ?]
