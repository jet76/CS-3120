# CS 3120 - Machine Learning

Description: Machine learning is the ability of computers to learn without explicitly programming an algorithm. Machine learning techniques learn about hyper-dimensional spaces with either explicit direction or implicit reinforcement. This course covers a variety of machine learning techniques and their application to actual data. Topics include the clustering of data and the retrieval of related data, the use of machine learning for recommender systems, and the creation of deep learning systems. This course includes both the underlying theory of machine learning and the creation of machine learning software for real-world problems.
